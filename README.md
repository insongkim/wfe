# wfe: Weighted Linear Fixed Effects Regression Models for Causal Inference [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/insongkim/wfe.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/insongkim/wfe) ![CRAN downloads](http://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/grand-total/wfe)

This R package provides a computationally efficient way of fitting
weighted linear fixed effects estimators for causal inference with
various weighting schemes. Imai and Kim (2016) show that weighted
linear fixed effects estimators can be used to estimate the average
treatment effects under different identification strategies. This
includes stratified randomized experiments, matching and
stratification for observational studies, first differencing, and
difference-in-differences. The package also provides various robust
standard errors and a specification test for standard linear fixed
effects estimators.
